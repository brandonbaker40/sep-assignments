Question 1:

This algorithm will always take the same amount of time to run, regardless of the size of the integer, n. Therefore, the Big-O of the algorithm is O(1), or constant time.

Question 2:

The time it takes for this algorithm to run will increase as the length of the collection increases. Therefore, the Big-O of the algorithm is O(n), or linear time.

Question 3:

The time it takes for this algorithm to run will increase as the length of the collection increases, even though it is a 2-dimensional collection. Therefore, the Big-O of the algorithm is O(n), or linear time.

Question 4:

The Big-O of the following algorithm is quadratic time, also known as polynomial time. The growth pattern of quadratic time most closely follows the output of the algorithm as n increases. See repl. https://repl.it/repls/UnimportantAstonishingOpensource

Question 6:
This algorithm is an implementation of quicksort. Quicksort's Big-O time complexity is n^2, so the Big-O of this algorithm must be n^2, or quadratic time.
