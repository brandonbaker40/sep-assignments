Lazy deletion
Lazy deletion is a method of removing elements from a hash table where deleted nodes are
"marked" as deleted while remaining in the data structure. It allows for overwriting with
the insert method, but treats "deleted" locations as occupied during the find method.
Lazy deletion dilutes the advantages of spatial locality since deleted nodes are taking
up space when they'll never be accessed. It's also wasteful of time since deleted nodes
increase the length of the path to the element to be accessed.

Random Hashing
Random hashing uses a pseudorandom number generator to generate a proposed location n
indexes from the collision location. This method can be deployed once a collision has occurred.
Random hashing can be expensive because of the PRNG.

Double hashing
Double hashing is a method where elements are hashed twice, hence the name -- "double hashing".
Elements are hashed for a second time when a collision occurred on the first hash function and
will keep calling the double hash method until the element is inserted into an empty location.
